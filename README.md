Package for *Peak Picking and ANnoTation of High resolution Experiments in R*, implemented in `R` and `Shiny`

## Overview

[**peakPantheR**](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/) is an R/Bioconductor package that implements functions to detect, integrate and report pre-defined features in MS files (*e.g. compounds, fragments, adducts, …*). It is designed for:

  - **Real time** feature detection and integration (see [Real Time Annotation](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/articles/real-time-annotation.html))
      - process `multiple` compounds in `one` file at a time
  - **Post-acquisition** feature detection, integration and reporting (see [Parallel Annotation](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/articles/parallel-annotation.html))
      - process `multiple` compounds in `multiple` files in `parallel`, store results in a `single` object

`peakPantheR` can process LC/MS data files in *NetCDF*, *mzML*/*mzXML* and *mzData* format as data import is achieved using Bioconductor’s [`mzR`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.10/mzR) package.

The reference versions of `peakPantheR` is available on the corresponding Bioconductor page ([release](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/peakPantheR.html) or [dev](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/peakPantheR.html) version).

Active development and issue tracking take place on the [github page](https://github.com/phenomecentre/peakPantheR), while an overview of the package, vignettes and documentation are available on the [supporting website](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/).

## Installation

To install [peakPantheR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/peakPantheR.html):
``` r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("peakPantheR")
```

To install the development version from GitHub:
``` r
BiocManager::install("phenomecentre/peakPantheR")
```

## Usage

Both real time and parallel compound integration require a common set of information:

  - Path(s) to `netCDF` / `mzML` MS file(s)
  - An expected region of interest (`RT` / `m/z` window) for each compound.

## Vignettes
An overview of the package and detailed information on usage are available in the following vignettes:

  - [Getting Started with peakPantheR](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/articles/getting-started.html)
  - [Real Time Annotation](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/articles/real-time-annotation.html)
  - [Parallel Annotation](https://phenomecentre.github.io/peakPantheR.github.io/articles/parallel-annotation.html)
  
## Examples
