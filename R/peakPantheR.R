#' peakPantheR: A package for Peak Picking and ANnoTation of High resolution
#' Experiments
#'
#' \pkg{peakPantheR} detects, integrates and reports pre-defined features in
#' mass spectrometry data files. It enables the real time annotation of multiple
#' compounds in a single file, or the parallel annotation of multiple compounds
#' in multiple files.
#'
#' The main functions of \pkg{peakPantheR} are
#' \code{\link{peakPantheR_singleFileSearch}} for realtime annotation, and
#' \code{\link{peakPantheR_parallelAnnotation}} for parallel annotation. The
#' \code{peakPantheRAnnotation} object stores parallel annotation results, while
#' reporting functions help assess and the quality of annotation and update
#' fitting parameters. Refer to the vignettes for graphical user interface and
#' command line tutorials.
