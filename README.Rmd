# peakPantheR
Package for _Peak Picking and ANnoTation of High resolution Experiments in R_, implemented in `R` and `Shiny`


## Overview

`peakPantheR` implements functions to detect, integrate and report pre-defined features in MS files (_e.g. compounds, fragments, adducts, ..._).
It is designed for:

* **Real time** feature detection and integration (see [Real Time Annotation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/phenomecentre/peakPantheR/blob/develop/doc/real-time-annotation.html))
    + process `multiple` compounds in `one` file at a time
* **Post-acquisition** feature detection, integration and reporting (see [Parallel Annotation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/phenomecentre/peakPantheR/blob/develop/doc/parallel-annotation.html))
    + process `multiple` compounds in `multiple` files in `parallel`, store results in a `single` object


`peakPantheR` can process LC/MS data files in _NetCDF_, _mzML_/_mzXML_ and _mzData_ format as data import is achieved using Bioconductor's [`mzR`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.10/mzR) package. 


## Installation

Install the development version of `peakPantheR`can directly from GitHub with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("phenomecentre/peakPantheR", ref="develop")
```


## Usage

Both real time and parallel compound integration require a common set of information:

* Path(s) to `netCDF` / `mzML` MS file(s)
* An expected region of interest (`RT` / `m/z` window) for each compound.
