Description: An automated pipeline for the detection, integration and reporting of predefined features across a large number of mass spectrometry data files.
    It enables the real time annotation of multiple compounds in a single file, or the parallel annotation of multiple compounds in multiple files.
    A graphical user interface as well as command line functions will assist in assessing the quality of annotation and update fitting parameters until a satisfactory result is obtained.
